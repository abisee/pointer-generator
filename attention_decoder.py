  """
  Args:
    decoder_inputs: A list of 2D Tensors [batch_size x input_size].
    initial_state: 2D Tensor [batch_size x cell.state_size].
    encoder_states: 3D Tensor [batch_size x attn_length x attn_size].
    enc_padding_mask: 2D Tensor [batch_size x attn_length] containing 1s and 0s; indicates which of the encoder locations are padding (0) or a real token (1).
    cell: rnn_cell.RNNCell defining the cell function and size.
    initial_state_attention:
      Note that this attention decoder passes each decoder input through a linear layer with the previous step's context vector to get a modified version of the input. If initial_state_attention is False, on the first decoder step the "previous context vector" is just a zero vector. If initial_state_attention is True, we use initial_state to (re)calculate the previous step's context vector. We set this to False for train/eval mode (because we call attention_decoder once for all decoder steps) and True for decode mode (because we call attention_decoder once for each decoder step).
    pointer_gen: boolean. If True, calculate the generation probability p_gen for each decoder step.
    use_coverage: boolean. If True, use coverage mechanism.
    prev_coverage:
      If not None, a tensor with shape (batch_size, attn_length). The previous step's coverage vector. This is only not None in decode mode when using coverage.

  Returns:
    outputs: A list of the same length as decoder_inputs of 2D Tensors of
      shape [batch_size x cell.output_size]. The output vectors.
    state: The final state of the decoder. A tensor shape [batch_size x cell.state_size].
    attn_dists: A list containing tensors of shape (batch_size,attn_length).
      The attention distributions for each decoder step.
    p_gens: List of scalars. The values of p_gen for each decoder step. Empty list if pointer_gen=False.
    coverage: Coverage vector on the last step computed. None if use_coverage=False.
